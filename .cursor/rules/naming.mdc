# Naming convention

Types, variables, and others, should follow a top down naming convention where the most generic term comes first.

Examples: We are creating different types of Records:

RIGHT: RecordProduction, RecordStaging
WRONG: ProductionRecord, StagingRecord

This way the DX improves because it's easier to remember the most common term, and then use Autocomplete from there onwards.
