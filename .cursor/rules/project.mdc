# Project

- This project is meant to be a library that adds functionality to other projects on which it's installed.
- When implementing new methods make sure these methods are needed in this project and are not part of the ../notion-cms-test/ project on which we're testing this library.
- This project should only contain general methods that should be made available to any project installing this library as a package.
